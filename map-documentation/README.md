# MAP-BACKEND
## Prerequisites ##
For the backend it is only needed to have node and mongodb installed.

 - MongoDB installed
 - Node installed
 
## Running the backend ##
 - Start mongo using `mongod` command
 - In the root directory of the backend code (map-backend) run `npm install`
 - In the root directory of the backend code (map-backend) run `npm run build`
 - In the root directory of the backend code (map-backend) run `npm run start` 

** Note: ** Make sure to have the backend running before starting the frontend

## Run tests ##
  - Start mongo using `mongod` command
  - In the root directory of the backend code (map-backend) run `npm test`

## Live updates in the map ##

Once the backend and frontend are running then you can start to use the API endpoint to check how the project is working, every time something is changed in the backend it will reflect in the frontend without the need to refresh the page.

** Note: ** To see when a place is open/close just click in the marker in the map to display a info-window

# MAP-FRONTEND
The map-frontend folder already has documentation about how to run the frontend, please refer to README.md in that folder.
